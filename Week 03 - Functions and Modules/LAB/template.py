# =================================================================== FUNCTIONS
# 1. Write a function called status_of(percent) that returns "OVER LIMIT"
#    (100% or more), "WARNING" (90% or more), or "OK" (anything else).
#
#    Typical and above: also write check(value, limit) that returns the
#    difference and the percentage as two values - do not print anything
#    inside it, only calculate and return.
#
#    Excellent: also write print_report(label, value, limit, difference,
#    percent, status) that does ALL of the printing below - nothing outside
#    it should contain a print() of its own.
#
#    Give each function a one-line docstring saying what it does.

# your function(s) go here


def status_of(percent):
    '''Returns the status of percent'''
    if percent >= 100:
        return "OVER LIMIT"
    elif percent >= 90:
        return "WARNING"
    else:
        return "OK"

def check(value, limit):
    '''Return the difference and percentage of value relative to limit'''
    return value - limit, (value / limit) * 100

def print_report(label, value, limit, difference, percent, status):
    '''Print a full report using label, value, limit, difference, percent and status'''
    print(f"Rows loaded   : {value:>10.2f}")
    print(f"Rows expected : {limit:>10.2f}")
    print(f"Difference    : {difference:>10.2f}")
    print(f"Percent       : {percent:>10.2f}%")
    print(f"Status        : {status:>10}")
    

# ==================================================================== INPUT
# 2. Ask for your three values.
#
#    - the first is TEXT      (a name, a hostname, an IP)  -> no conversion needed
#    - the second is a NUMBER (use float(), not int())
#    - the third  is a NUMBER (use float(), not int())

over_limit = 0

while True:
    dataset_name = input("Enter dataset name: ")
    if dataset_name.upper() == "QUIT":
        break
    rows_loaded = float(input("Enter number of rows loaded: "))
    rows_expected = float(input("Enter number of rows expected: "))


# ================================================================== PROCESS
# 3. Work out the difference, the percentage, and the status.
#
#    Threshold : call status_of() to get the status. Work out the
#                difference and percentage inline, not in a function.
#    Typical   : call check() to get the difference and percentage instead.

    difference, percent = check(rows_loaded, rows_expected)
    status = status_of(percent)

    if status == "OVER LIMIT":
        over_limit += 1


# =================================================================== OUTPUT
# 4. Print the report.
#
#    Threshold : the three values you were given, plus status, inside a border
#    Typical   : add difference and percent, 2 decimal places, right-aligned
#    Excellent : call print_report() instead of printing directly here, and
#                wrap sections 2-4 in a loop so you can check as many records
#                as you like in one run - type "quit" as the label to stop.
#                Keep count of how many came back OVER LIMIT and print that
#                once, after the loop ends.


    print()
    print("=" * 34)
    print(f"  RECORD CHECK  -  {dataset_name}")
    print("=" * 34)

# your report lines go here

    print_report(dataset_name, rows_loaded, rows_expected, difference, percent, status)

    print("=" * 34)

print()
print(f"{over_limit} records were over limit")


# ==========================================================================
# 5. Before you finish:
#
#    [ ] Run it three times with different numbers
#    [ ] Run it with a total of 0 and note the error (do not fix it yet)
#    [ ] Check every function does one job - if a function both calculates
#        and prints, split it
